# LifeExpectancy

The project relies on accuracy of data. The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries.
The data-set is related to life expectancy. Health factors for 193 countries have been collected from the same WHO data repository website and its corresponding economic data were collected from United Nation website.

The aim of the project is to predict the life expectancy of the population. 
This is a regression problem and algorithms that I used are:
  1) Linear Regression (Ridge and Lasso)
  2) K-nearest Neighbours Regression
  3) Decision tree
  
PDF file "life_expectancy_report" contains a detailed description of algorithms that were used in the code and also their performance measures.
